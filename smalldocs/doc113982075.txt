hamlet revengful or not shakespeare uses revenge as a major theme present throughout the work revenge plays a crucial role in the development of fortinbras prince of norway hamlet prince of denmark and laertes son of polonius all three men seek revenge for the murder of their fathers revenge can be interpreted as a separate character in hamlet revenge is set to overcome anyone who seeks it initially after each of the murders every son had a definite course of action to obtain vengeance or in hamlets case the choice was to seek no vengeance as the play unfolds each young man approaches the desire for revenge and chooses a different path towards gaining it based on the guidance of another character in the play fortinbras good decisions and selfcontrol as well as hamlet and laertes bad decisions can be attributed to the outside guidance they receive fortinbras son of the slain king of norway is the first to seek revenge although king hamlet the now deceased king of denmark held sole responsibility for the death of king fortinbras young prince fortinbras seeks vengeance toward the entire country of denmark horatio a friend of hamlets said as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost ii113116 by this horatio is saying fortinbras plans to forcefully regain the land king hamlet took from king fortinbras fortunately king claudius the new king of denmark intervenes and sends two courtiers cornelius and voltemand to norway in hopes of convincing the new king of norway fortinbras uncle to prevent the attack upon hearing the message fortinbras uncle vetoes fortinbras plan to wage war on denmark however he encourages fortinbras to employ his anger against the polack in order to vent his rage iiii7475 after taking the advice of his uncle fortinbras additionally makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty iiii7475 this intervention could be what saves fortinbras life with the counseling of his uncle fortinbras is able to put aside his longing to settle the score for his fathers murder in the end he is greatly rewarded because of his persistent doubt of whether claudius did in fact kill his father hamlet defers making plans to act out his revenge hamlet is the hardest of the three sons to be influenced to act vengefully although deeply sorrowed by his fathers death he did not consider payback as an option until he meets with the ghost of his father the ghost tells hamlet king claudius his own brother murdered him the ghost then tells hamlet to revenge his foul and most unnatural murder iv32 although murder was an acceptable form of revenge in hamlets time he is uncertain about killing claudius however upon his fathers command hamlet reluctantly swears to retaliate against claudius hamlet does this not because he wants to but because his father makes it clear that it is his duty as a son hamlet promises to prove his love and duty by killing claudius hamlet unlike fortinbras and laertes did not follow what his advisor told him without questioning why he should take the advice as time passes hamlet still has not acted out the revenge he promised his father out of disgust for his irreverence for his father he says why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall acursing like a very drab iiii611615 this statement prompts one to believe hamlet has been convinced by his fathers words to act but does not want to do so hastily hamlet questions the validity of his revenge by devising a plan to provide evidence of king claudius guilt hamlet took advantage of his position at the local theater by instructing his actors to perform a play which reenacts a murder similar to his fathers then based on claudius response to the play hamlet could conclude his guilt or innocence hamlet says ill have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his looks ill tent him to the quick iiii623626 after seeing claudius response to the play hamlet affirms the kings guilt and proceeds with his plan to kill him hamlet had a stronger conscience than fortinbras or laertes therefore he gave the most thought to his strategy of revenge even after hamlet decides to kill claudius he continues to question how his revenge will affect himself as well as the king in hamlets to be or not to be soliloquy he says thus conscience does make cowards of us all iiii91 by conscience hamlet is referring to looking into his mind and feelings hamlet is saying his conscience is in turmoil his world is falling apart although he fears the consequences of murdering claudius it seems like he feels obligated by guilt to continue with his plan because of the responsibility his father placed upon him hamlet is overcome with rage now he not only wants to kill claudius but he wants to ensure that claudius will go to hell when he is killed in a vain attempt to slay king claudius hamlet inadvertently kills polonius even after all the careful consideration hamlet gave to planning his revenge he makes that deadly mistake laertes puts the least amount of thought into his revenge and is the most easily influenced of the three sons he confronts claudius at once after hearing about his father polonius death claudius tells laertes hamlet slew his father laertes vows to kill hamlet by saying let come what comes only ill be revenged most thoroughly for my father ivv153154 when king claudius inquires how laertes plans to kill hamlet laertes replies to cut his throat i the church ivvii143 the king advises laertes to wait until hamlet returns home to kill him claudius wants to invite frenchmen to bet on the duel between hamlet and claudius king claudius claims hamlet will not want to fight and assures laertes victory the kings plan to kill hamlet was supposedly foolproof laertes would fight with a poisontipped sword and hamlet would be served poisoned wine to ensure his death when laertes confronts hamlet he is so blinded by rage he refuses to consider hamlets apology laertes proceeds to fight hamlet with his poisoned sword during the swordfight both men are wounded laertes plan to seek revenge on hamlet was successful but it cost him his own life laertes was firm in his desire for revenge it is definite that he would have sought revenge regardless of advice from anyone however he may not have died if it had not been for king claudius advice in hamlets dying moment he attacks claudius and forces him to drink the poison which claudius had intended to kill hamlet thus hamlet avenged his fathers death unfortunately he was dying of the wound inflicted by laertes as hamlet is dying he wills his fathers land and crown to fortinbras due to the guidance of king claudius young fortinbras regained his fathers land without the use of violence or death to himself the chain of events leading to the success of fortinbras and the failure of hamlet and laertes was initiated by a command from someone close to them king claudius had an ulterior motive of saving his land yet by telling fortinbras uncle of fortinbras plan to attack denmark his uncle was able to deter his nephews anger by choosing not to attack denmark fortinbras was able to avoid harms way the ghost of hamlets father caused hamlets death by advising hamlet to seek revenge before his encounter with his father hamlet did not want any part in the act of revenge in attempt to pursue his fathers wishes hamlet kills polonius which causes his death when laertes listens to king claudius he brings death upon both of them laertes did not think his sword would be used against him in the end the mens fate was determined not only by their own feelings but by the actions taken under the command of another person for hamlet and laertes successful revenge led them to death the guidance he received as well as inner strength surmounted fortinbras need for revenge and led him to happiness
