hamlet the character of hamlet in the film with mel gibson seems to be an accurate portrayal of hamlet in shakespeares play in both the play and the movie hamlet is viewed by many to be insane mel gibson did a great job in playing the role of hamlet for many reasons first mel gibson does a wonderful job by not giving way by not revealing the secrecy of his madness to anyone the character of hamlet in the play is also failed by women first by his mother and second by ophelia the woman he is in love with this is seen with much detail in the movie mel gibson also did a great job in expressing hamlets emotions and enthusiasm to reveal hamlets actual feelings throughout the movie the characterization of hamlet in the play as well as the movie are very similar hamlet is very smart character in the play many of the characters in the play believe the hamlet is mad hamlet uses this to his advantage by pretending to be mad so he can view how other characters view him when someone is considered insane or mad people around them tend to speak more openly and freely and hamlet is aware of this at one point in the play polonius approaches hamlet to see if he can finess a little information that he needs out of hamlet hamlet knows polonius very well but when polonius approaches him he makes believe that he barley knows him this makes polonius question hamlet as a rational man polonius still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first a said i was a fishmonger a far again he knows who polonius is but by calling polonius a fishmonger and asking if he has a daughter makes polonius believe that hamlet is mentally ill in the movie mel gibson portrayed this seen with greatness because he never gave away his true feelings about the situation at hand mel gibson also does an excellent job in revealing hamlets emotions towards his mother for marrying his uncle so quickly after his fathers death mel gibson uses great facial expressions and body language for what hamlet believes is disrespecting his father hamlet thrift thrift horatio the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage after only seeing the first seen in the movie i could sense the fury and ill emotions towards his mother from his body language alone later ophelia lies to hamlet and at this moment is when his is failed by a woman for the second time in the movie we can see how it is destroying hmalet because he wants to tell ophelia the truth when ophelia lies you can see through his facial expressions alone that he is mortified emotions are seeping out of hamlet in the play and mel gibson does an excellent job in showing this in the movie in addition since i read the play before i saw the movie i already had preconceptions on how hamlets tone in certain situations should sound like in the movie his emotions are portrayed with precision when hamlet is infuriated you can feel the anger radiate through him by the tone of his voice and when his is disturbed you can feel the disgust in his voice when he is speaking to ophelia you can feel the pain the pain and suffering from disappointment he feels through his voice and tone the emotions we feel in the play are just as easily felt when watching the movie mel gibson really did an excellent job in portraying the character of hamlet as it was in shakespeares play
