hamlet essay william shakespeares three plays julius caesar hamlet and othello all contain the same basic premise within their plots one being the supernatural in julius caesar the ghost of caesar appears in front of brutus strange occurances happen at night and calpurnia has an extraordinary dream about caesar in hamlet the play in its entirety truly begins once king hamlets ghost appears and commands his son to avenge the wrongful death of the king in othello although there are no actual spirits looming one symbolic handkerchief sets othello into a jealous rage leading to chaos these three shakesperian plays contain supernatural figures or events that foreshadow or control the entire plot of each play there are numerous supernatural events that carry forth in julius caesar all of which that portend danger or murder one night caesar awakens to the screams of his wife calpurnia she begins to tell her husband that she has had three terrible nightmares and explains what has happened in the city that night yet now they frighten mebesides the things that we have heard and seenrecounts most horrid sights seen by the watcha lioness hath whelped the streetsgraves have yawnd and yielded up their deadfiery warriors fought upon the cloudswhich drizzled blood upon the capitolghosts did shriek and squeal about the streetsi do fear them calpurnia was never one to heed omens yet these supernatural occurrences frighten her and she insists that caesar not leave the house however caesar being the proud tyrant of the house insists that he must attend the senate hearing and dismisses her fears caesar then is stabbed to death by the conspirators proving that the supernatural omens held truth after caesars death brutus and cassius are left to fight those who loved him before battle brutus is approached by caesars ghost brutus speak to me what thou artghost thy evil spirit brutusto tell thee thou shalt seem me at philipiay at philippi this appearance deeply concerns brutus and begins stirring up fear in his character now i have taken heart though vanishestill spirit i would hold more talk with thee eventually just as the appearance of caesars evil spirit suggests brutus dies once again proving that the supernatural events control the outcome of the play the strange dreams and occurrences that calpurnia was aware of foreshadowed caesars death just as caesars evil spirit foreshadowed brutuss death although there arent as many supernatural events in hamlet as there are in julius caesar the only spirit that exists plays the largest part in the play king hamlets spirit appears and informs his son prince hamlet that his murderer was claudius and his death must be avenged to ears of flesh and bloodlist list o listif thou didst ever thy dear father loverevenge his foul and most unnatural murder king hamlet demands revenge and prince hamlet abides as mediation or the thoughts of lovemay sweep to my revenge by commanding prince hamlet to avenge his death he creates the plot of the play from the fifth scene of act i to the very end in essence if king hamlet creates that plotline he thus controls the plot and his sons actions aside from the deaths of other characters claudius is killed by hamlet thus proving that the supernatural events that brought forth in the beginning influenced the outcome of the play the most subtle yet clearly significant supernatural aspect of the three plays appears in othello the drop of a mere handkerchief stirs up chaos within othello and desdemonas marriage emilia iagos wife steals the handkerchief from desdemona and gives it to iago who is then left to construct more evil deeds in order to break up othellos marriage and ruin his life he gleefully plants it in michael cassios room and informs othello of the affair iago tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchiefspotted with strawberries in your wifes hand othello i gave her such one twas my first gift iago i know not that but such a handkerchiefi am sure it was your wifesdid i todaysee cassio wipe his beard with this enrages othello ill tear her to piecesarise black vengeance from thy hollow hell from this point on othello is no longer the confident strongwilled character he was in the beginning of the play rather he is filled with anger rage and paranoia by the end of the play othello stabs himself desdemona is murdered and iago is sentenced to death all inhibited by the placement of a handkerchief although a handkerchief isnt as supernatural as a ghost or any other kind of spirit it still contains the same premises of those that occurred in julius caesar and hamlet it controls the plot and influences the outcome at the end of the play the supernatural is an aspect of these three shakesperian plays that create a vital role in the plot not only does it control the plot following the supernatural event it foreshadows and influences the outcome of the play in julius caesar the dreams and omens of calpurnia foreshadow caesars murder just as caesars spirit did to brutuss death king hamlets spirit controls most of the play by informing his son of his murderer and asking for revenge lastly the most inconspicuous supernatural event of the three plays the handkerchief in othello enrages othello himself and leads to the end of his marriage and even his life
