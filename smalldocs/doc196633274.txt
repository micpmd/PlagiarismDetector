the ghost in hamlet in the shakespearean time period people believed in ghosts and reported them so it makes sense that shakespeare would write about a ghost appearing in the play there is plenty of evidence in the play to prove that the ghost is real in the first act the ghost appears to two soldiers marcellus and barnardo as well as to hamlets friend horatio who is a very credible and intelligent person the same ghost appeared to hamlet several times through out the play also these facts eliminate the chance of this ghost being a figment of peoples imagination because too many people saw the same thing in act 1 scene 1 it is revealed that the ghost appeared twice wearing the same armor king hamlet wore when he fought the ambitious old fortinbras king of norway and also when he defeated the poles young fortinbras is determined to get back the land his father lost this fact brings more in depth evidence to the ghost being real the reason the guards are there on watch is a direct relationship to an attack from fortinbras and the ghost is wearing the armor of the event that started this whole thingwhen the ghost asks hamlet to avenge his death he reveals a true fact involving the death of king hamletghost i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou the fat weed that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark in by a forged process of my death rankly abused but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy fathers life now wears his crownhamlet o my prophetic soul my uncle 13 3848 later in the play is revealed that claudius murdered king hamlet in order to achieve the crown himself this fact proves the reality of the ghost claudius admits to killing king hamlet in a prayer since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen33 5759 the ghost told hamlet about that fact before claudias ever admits it the sanity of hamlet comes into question but is not relevant because there are three other witnesses however the ghost appeared to hamlet in the presence of gertrude he saw it she didnt this doesnt necessarily mean hamlet is crazy maybe the ghost only appears to whom it wants to appear to the ghost may not want gertrude to know about the plan to kill claudius the evidence in the play shows the fact that the ghost was real the ghost was not a figment of peoples imagination
