twelth night act 3 act three opens at the garden adjoining olivias house this garden is where lines 1 100 will occur often times the garden is portrayed onstage as a courtyard with real plants a backdrop or a combination of both several columns are usually added to olivias house and the courtyard in order to add a mediterranean atmosphere to shakespeares illyria twelfth night takes place in duke orsinos court olivias house olivias garden and to a much lesser extent on a street and beach of illyria this allows for the production to have fairly elaborate scenery because the set changes are simple and far enough apart to accommodate the minor adjustments that transform olivias house into orsinos domicile a play on gender and sexuality is the main action of twelfth night however this scene focuses on the importance and duality of words the primary action of act three scene one occurs in the dialogue what ensues is a brilliant example of shakespeares mastery of the english language instead of the physical fighting found in romeo and juliet or hamlet shakespeare creates a playful bandying of words and wit the result of which adds an interesting dimension to viola by merit of her quick wit and clever thinking the portrayal of viola as a bright selfsufficient and accomplished female almost makes her a foil to the gullible and flighty olivia scene one begins with violacesario returning to olivias house to continue the duke orsinos overtures in the garden she meets feste the fool the conversation that follows is heated and reveals a great deal about festes role in the play feste is shown to be not just a comic relief figure like sir andrew he is perceptive when others are not as viola notes after the encounter the conversation is so spirited because feste and viola actually have a good deal in common both are paid servants who are much more than they seem to be and hence present some threat to each other as they search out each others secrets through several insightful comments the audience is left to hypothesize that feste may have discerned violas true gender unlike olivia orsino and the others viola knows that feste is anything but a fool as she later says of feste the fellow is wise enough to play the fool and to do that well craves a kind of wit act 3 scene 1 line 59 viola and feste continue to verbally spar with each other until viola tires of it she claims that they who dally nicely with words may quickly make them wantonact 3 scene 1 line 14 after more playful deliberations about festes job title as olivias fool he leaves to call olivia however before he leaves he taunts viola for not having a beard possibly making a final allusion to her true gender while viola is waiting in the garden sir toby and sir andrew enter and greet her sir andrew addresses viola in french he is just trying to assert his superiority and assumes that the boy will not understand him sir andrew is impressed when viola thwarts him by responding in french having used up the little french he knows he is barely able to formulate an appropriate answer in english sir toby steps in and asks viola to enter the house just as she is about to enter the house olivia and maria come out violas attention abruptly focuses on olivia as she formally greets the countess this refined way of greeting olivia impresses sir andrew even more than viola speaking french viola continues to flatter olivia with formalities and is carefully observed by sir andrew all the while sir andrew is providing comic relief by flustering at all of violas flatteries and olivias favorable responses just as sir andrew is about to top viola olivia orders everyone to leave except for violacesario this reinforces the assumption that olivia is in love with cesario the action is then transferred to olivia and violas dialogue instead of verbal sparring the dialogue now introduces the main problem of the story when they are alone olivia makes it clear that she is not interested in orsino and she does not want to think of orsino at all the audience now knows that orsino loves olivia who loves violacesario who loves orsino viola is now trapped because olivia loves her and she doesnt want to hurt olivia or reveal her true identity this scene is the climax of the main plot as olivia passionately declares her love for cesarioviola her behavior is unusual for a young lady who is mourning and who is superior to the young pageboy the declaration of her love places viola in a very delicate situation viola must now keep her own identity a secret repulse olivias love and continue to plead orsinos case with olivia while suppressing her own love for him and taking care not to hurt olivia too deeply the plot therefore becomes further complicated before it begins to unravel in the following scenes although the scene begins with a playful and harmless verbal bantering between two bright minds that of feste and viola it soon devolves to a darker look at how words can hurt people viola is quite aware that her rejection of olivia is causing her much pain yet she cannot be her true self without the risk of being hurt herself this scene brings the reader back to the main plot after having been diverted by the action of the malvolio subplot in the previous scene it also reveals a new side plot as sir andrew becomes interested in viola because of olivias interest in her scene one is one of the most interesting scenes for an audience of twelfth night it includes the climax of the main plot and has constant action from beginning to end all this is accomplished almost entirely through dialogue alone one might infer that shakespeare wrote the scene to be foolproof because all of the interesting events in the scene occur in the dialogue and require little stage direction shakespeares ability to captivate an entire audience without resorting to blood and guts or slapstick makes twelfth night an extremely clever comedy and an enduring classic
