criticism of shakespeare and his drama the legacy of one man has reached the hearts of millions of people throughout the centuries men and women from all walks of life have read his poetic words and have been touched in a way that no other author has ever been able to duplicate the works of william shakespeare have never been forgotten despite the fact that his plays and poems were written hundreds of years ago every one of his plays was written with a mastery unknown before his time and never seen again yet these plays have often become the topic of controversy as those involved in the debate have come to different conclusions regarding the exact meaning of shakespeares words one single theme or passage of a play can create several different schools of thought therefore it is necessary to examine each play thoroughly and discover how different people understand the works of shakespeare as well as the bard himself to understand why shakespeares works have so often been the subject of controversy one must first realize that there has been a long standing debate over the actual authorship of the famous shakespearian works some attribute his works to francis bacon christopher marlowe or to edward de vere the earl of oxford the prime contender of these three to shakespeare would be de vere critics say that these men were far more likely to be able to write these ingenious plays due to their education and social standing shakespeare was only educated in grammar school yet it is important to note that the grammar schools of shakespeares days were quite different from that of todays schools shakespeare would have been educated in latin and other highly intellectual subjects up until the point that he was a teenager some oxfordians claim that because shakespeares name has been found to be spelled differently on several different works it means that a different person wrote each work blum 112 yet there are even problems with the de vere theory de vere died in 1604 yet many stratfordian scholars date many of the plays to be as late as 1613 however it is important to point out that no matter who the true author is the plays will still have the same affect on the lives of those who read them despite the authorship the artistic problem would remain untouched because that drama remains always the same lear laments and imprecates in the same manner othello struggles furiously hamlet meditates and wavers before the problem of humanity and the action that he is called upon to take and in the same manner all are enwrapped in the veil of eternity krull 32 only a few surviving documents give any glimpse into the life of shakespeare while there are historical records that prove he was an actual person during this time period only a few other documents provide any information about the writers life he was born in april 1564 in the market town of stratforduponavon and died in april 1616 he attended the kings new school which was known for its academic success this school was one of the english grammar schools established to educate young men in latin grammar and literature shakespeare began his studies at the age of five in petty school where he was taught how to read and write in english after two years of the petty school he began the serious study of latin mowat 32 after his formal schooling ended his professional life in london began at the age of eighteen he was married to anne hathaway a few years later in 1583 shakespeares daughter susanna was born followed by the births of twins hamnet and judith in 1585 by 1592 he had achieved some prominence in london as an actor and a playwright during the 1590s he wrote his plays on english history as well as several comedies and two tragedies many of his sonnets were also written at this time however in 1596 shakespeare suffered the loss of one of his twins hamnet despite this in 1599 shakespeares company built a theatre across the river from london named the globe several of shakespeares famous tragedies were written and performed in this theatre such as hamlet othello king lear and macbeth shakespeare was not only a playwright in this theatre but he was also an actor and a stockholder in the finances of the globe yet in 1613 during a performance of henry viii the globe caught fire and burned to the ground three years later on april 25 1616 william shakespeare died and was buried inside the chancel of holy trinity church in stratford seven years after his death his collected plays were published as mr william shakespeares comedies histories tragedies which later became known as the first folio claybourne 10 the most well known of all of shakespeares tragedies would be the tragedy of hamlet prince of denmark or as it is called today hamlet throughout this play several running themes are presented continuously one that has stirred quite a controversy over the years would be the theme concerning the oedipus complex this scenario is described at one relatively simple level where the oedipal pattern is in several ways involved there is the first desire to eliminate the father or to see him claudius eliminated by others besides oneself this is a strategy that becomes a disguise for the desire in which claudius act offers hamlet the appearance of an innocent motive frees him from guilt and lets him pursue out of hatred the murderer of the ideal father the fact that this murderer is also the husband of his mother makes claudius into somewhat of a father figure and no longer the ideal parent that a child would take as a model but as the parent hated because of the place he occupies in the oedipal triangle bates 212 many productions of hamlet have included the oedipus theme as a central part of the play some directors strongly believe that hamlet had a secret desire for his own mother which only intensified his feelings of revenge and hatred toward claudius there has also been criticism of the interpretations of hamlet itself professor r stoll of the university of minnesota noted that the critics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries knew less about psychology than more recent hamlet critics but they were nearer in spirit to shakespeares art and as they insisted on the importance of the effect of the whole rather than on the importance of the leading character they were nearer in their oldfashioned way to the secret of dramatic art in general some critics have failed in their interpretation of hamlet because they are trying to interpret a piece of art that cannot be justly translated there are pieces of this artwork that cannot be rightly appreciated in our time period several simple concepts of the play that one cannot understand today was blatantly obvious to the audiences of shakespeares time one more point that needs to be addressed would be the criticism of hamlet as an actual piece of art there are critics who find hamlet to be a hastily written poor example of theatre shakespeare originally based this play upon the tale of thomas kyds belleforest from the spanish tragedy in kyds production there is a clear revengeonly motive the delay similar to hamlets was due to the difficulty of assassinating a monarch because of surrounding guards and the madness of hamlet was feigned in order to escape suspicion it may seem to some that shakespeare was merely revising the work of kyd and not for the better mr j m robertson of the university of minnesota is quite concise of his opinion of shakespeares work on hamlet so far from being shakespeares masterpiece the play is most certainly an artistic failure in several ways the play is puzzling and disquieting as is none of the others of all the plays it is the longest and is possibly the one on which shakespeare spent most pains and yet he has left in it superfluous and inconsistent scenes which even hasty revision should have noticed one of the most widely performed shakespearian comedies of the present time is a midsummer nights dream it is seen to be a delightful comedy but full of enough potential tragedy to avoid becoming sugary many critics believe that shakespeare drew upon many different classical traditional and romance sources including plutarch chaucer ovid and apuleius to create this play this is quite a contrast from his other plays due to the fact that shakespeare would usually pick one general work from another author and expound upon that however there are critics such as judith m kennedy who are convinced that book i of jorge de montemayors diana gave shakespeare the initial action of the play therefore there is even controversy among the critics as to where shakespeare originated his thoughts for a midsummer nights dream rossiter 142 some critics have referred to a midsummer nights dream as shakespeares original wedding play most scholars believe that shakespeare wrote it as a light entertainment to accompany a marriage celebration because he did not rely directly upon existing plays narrative poetry historical chronicles or any other primary source materials as was discussed previously this play has been seen by most to be one of shakespeares truly original pieces a midsummer nights dream contains expressions of lighter shakespearean themes such as love dreams and the creative imagination shaheen 97 this famous play has always had its share of harsh critics harry rusche of emory university states that a midsummer nights dream as shakespeare had originally written it was not immensely popular to begin with even as far back as the sixteen hundreds men were criticizing his works this time specifically a midsummer nights dream in september of 1662 diarist samuel pepys went to the kings theatre where we saw midsummer nights dream which i had never seen before nor shall ever again for it is the most insipid ridiculous play that ever i saw in my life pepys did not think the performance was a total waste he did see some good dancing and some handsome women marx 55 perhaps the setting which included fanciful landscape fireflies toadstools fairies and elves were all too much for pepys to take in all at once images such as these were contrary to the christian view of the world therefore this may have been somewhat offensive to pepys or perhaps he merely could not appreciate fine theatre dr julia brown of stanford university believes that intertwined within the plot of a midsummer nights dream is the explicit reference to elizabeth i by drawing from the network of images and symbols that she encouraged to uphold her reputation as the virgin queen elizabeth i supported the images enhancing the legend of her virginity because her society demanded chastity from its unmarried women in particular shakespeare uses the image of diana in his play according to brown shakespeare takes full advantage of elizabeths established iconography particularly images of elizabeth as diana to make her a presence in this play while shakespeare does use this iconography in order to compliment the virgin queen he also hits at elizabeths dual reputation by focusing on the image of the bow he does this by using the image of the bow the weapon of choice for both diana and cupid because of queen elizabeths established iconography he was able to do this in a subtle yet loyal way brown also states that shakespeare was obviously complimenting elizabeth when he refers to diana equivalent to elizabeth in this text in act 2 scene 1 lines 15564 as a fair vestal throned by the westbrown 24 in every play ever written there can be evidence of controversy and a basis for speculation yet no other playwright has ever face such criticism as shakespeare has for his plays and sonnets perhaps this is due to the frankness and honesty with which he writes even though his tragedy macbeth was written to please king james it was immediately banned and not allowed to be performed for a full five years what is it that causes so much fear from these plays it evidently boils down to the personal effect that shakespeare has had on the individual reader what these people do with their own speculation on the plays is what brings about such heated debates on this topic each play written by shakespeare has its own uniqueness which will inevitably draw criticism from those who read it how could there not be criticism and controversy over the plays when there is controversy over the actual authorship to begin with when all of this is put aside and the reader is able to comprehend the plays for their literary value incredible insight and thought can take place these works have the power to reach the human soul and spark passion critical thought within the reader or audience member shakespeares plays have inspired some of the greatest writers of the past centuries such as herrick and milton through the last ballad writers to thomson and gray and then onto percy and chatterton and finally culminating in keats and coleridge there is scarcely a person to be found that does not know the name of william shakespeare his impact on all cultures in every country is phenomenal and even though there will always be controversies surrounding his name and works william shakespeare will continue to be the most profound writer ever to create a play
