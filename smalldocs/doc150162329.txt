hamlet a mind of his own no one can argue that the best piece of writing ever done by william shakespeare is hamlet which is a classic example of a tragedy do all tragedies end with the hero suffering and usually dying in the end this is not all that is needed to consider a play a tragedy and sometimes a hero does not need to die but not every play in which a hero dies is considered a tragedy is it a heros destiny to die hamlets death could have been avoided many times but what leads up to his death is what makes this play hamlet had many opportunities to kill claudius but did not take advantage of them a tragic hero does not need to be good or does he in hamlet although hamlet dies it is almost for the best or is it how could he have any pleasure during the rest of his life with his parents and ophelia dead hamlet had possessed many good traits needed to be a tragic hero but he had one flaw which eventually lead to his downfall hamlet has all the food traits of a tragic hero he is brave and daring hamlet was also loyal to his father another trait that hamlet had is that he was intelligent how else would hamlet be able to think up the idea of faking insanity by reading further you will be able to see how this play unfolds two of the guards of the kings castle discover that there is a ghost probable of the recently deceased king hamlet horatio declares that the ghost must bring warning of impending misfortune when the ghost appears the second time horatio tries to communicate with the ghost to no avail the ghost disappears horatio decided to tell prince hamlet of the ghost if it is indeed the king it will most likely talk to his beloved son horatio thinks that with the appearance of the ghost and it not speaking to him it indicated that something is wrong in denmark this scene introduces the character horatio who is a major character in this scene besides the ghost before horatio sees the ghost he insists tush tush twill not appear1129 prince hamlet is mourning his fathers death hamlet is also enraged about the marriage of his mother gertrude to his uncle claudius who is now the new king laertes gets a pass from king claudius to go to france laertes talkes to ophelia about rejecting hamlets love for it is not a good love for he is mad in the head ophelia considers her brothers advice even though she loves hamlet when laertes leaves lord polonius ophelias father again asked ophelia not to fall in love with hamlet ophelia considers her fathers and brothers request ophelia in despair agrees with her affection for hamlet when the ghost appears to hamlet he knows it is his father the ghost describes to hamlet the circumstance of his death the ghost tells him that claudius killed him or had him killed king claudius and gertrude tried to find out if hamlet is indeed insane king claudius and gertrude send rosengrantz and guildenstern who pretended to be friends of hamlets to determine why hamlets behavior has been erratic and peculiar polonius comes in to tell king claudius that he thinks hamlets madness is due to the rejected love for ophelia polonius investigates hamlets madness by having ophelia confront hamlet and also both king claudius and queen gertrude ophelia is hoping the queen gertrude and king claudius have a clue toward the reason for hamlets madness hamlet said there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison22245246 the argument of whether hamlet is insane because of his love for ophelia is often debated but a more confusing and complex situation is the struggle within hamlets mind in this scene hamlet recites his famous speech to be or not to be that is the question whether tis noble in the mind to suffer3156 here we truly realize that hamlet is torn two ways in his life with this famous speech by hamlet essentially it is showing that hamlet is debating on whether he should consider the pains of living in such a harsh world and fight to avenge his fathers murder or take his own life hamlet has to choose between being a coward in the peoples eyes or not when he considers taking his own life hamlet leaves us with the message that life is indeed worth living even by imperfect people in an imperfect worldfriedlander hamlet is preparing a play the describes how a nephew of the king murders the king and gets both the queen and the crown king claudius reaction to the play makes hamlet certain that claudius is the murderer of his father king hamlet claudius leaves the room to calm himself down from the agonizing depression of the play hamlet follows claudius and tries to kill him but he finds claudius is confessing his crime and is asking for forgiveness hamlet enters his mothers bedroom at her wish and first kills polonius hamlet thought that polonius was claudius that is why polonius is died hamlets madness at times is justified and at other times is pure insanity at first hamlet seems to be going mad over the fact that he is not allowed to see ophelia then it seems that the fact that he is overwhelmed with his fathers death and begins to fight with himself over the thought of suicide he is then determined to gain revenge for his father and goes about torturing claudius in s systematic and genius manner queen gertrude informs king claudius of the fact that hamlet killed polonius king claudius wants to send hamlet away but wonders what the people will think of him if he does this king claudius ponders about this then decides it is the best thing to do rosencrantz and guildenstern escort hamlet away by request of the king hamlet runs into fortinbras that is going to invade poland by crossing norway the queen is talking to ophelia which is acting insane then king claudius enters and wonders what is wrong with ophelia for she is acting really strange king claudius has horatio follow her for king claudius does not know what ophelia will do laertes comes back from france because of his fathers death laertes after seeing ophelias sanity is in deep grief king claudius uses laertes as a tool to extinguish hamlet meanwhile gertrude enters to announce that ophelia has drowned laertes flees thinking hamlet has killed his sister hamlet returns to england to find out that his love ophelia is dead hamlet is asked if he intends to come to the dual that king claudius has established or not hamlet hears of ophelias death and goes to the graveyard laertes comes after hamlet thinking that he is the reason his sister is dead the devil take thy soul51241 laertes jumps at hamlet to kill him hamlet and horatio talk horatio is uncertain about the dual he has feelings something is wrong laertes and hamlet dual some hamlet had two hits king claudius tries to get hamlet to drink from his glass hamlet refuses the queen drinks from hamlets glass not knowing that the poison is in the glass the dual continues as the queen gets more of the poison in her system hamlet goes to the queen as she falls off her chair the queen tells hamlet it was the drink that did her in the queen dies hamlet gets the poison sword and wounds laertes during laertes death he exposes that king claudius is the person who planned this murder trick although hamlet who was also wounded by the poisonous sword he comes to king claudius with the sword and forces him to drink the rest of poisoned wine that queen gertrude left king claudius dies in torture hamlet asks horatio not to commit suicide but instead tell his story to the people at the end fortinbras come to denmark with an english ambassador hamlet hopes that fortinbras can be the king of denmark and asks horatio to tell his story to fortinbras also fortinbras after hamlets death announces hamlet will be buried as a soldier in conclusion hamlet is not insane his murder of lord polonius and king claudius is committed by his clear and clever mind his insanity is one of his ancillary tact to help him prepare a perfect revenge for his fathers death in his insanity hamlet exhibits another concealed personality
