hamlet i feel that shakespeare employed elements of both episodic and climactic when writing hamlet the play seems to fall mostly under episodic however there are distinct traces of climactic on which i will comment later the play featured a multitude of characters in a number of places kings lords servants and princes from norway denmark and france fraternizing in graveyards poloniuss house and various rooms in the castle hamlet contained more speaking roles than any play id ever encountered this demonstrates the first element of episodic structure it also featured a handful of subplots the norwegians plans to invade poland laertess desire for revenge the sparks that flew between hamlet and ophelia what i admire so much about these subplots is that theyre barely subplots theyre almost a part of the main story line but just unrelated enough to qualify as subplots this is effective in building tension as well as satisfying the second element of episodic drama there werent a lot of happy scenes in hamlet but the contrast between sad and funny was very clear in act ii scene 2 hamlet is rambling like a lunatic to the point that its hilarious i laughed out loud while reading it once he is alone onstage he goes into an extensive depressing monologue about his current situation then contrast between his comical display of lunacy and the disparity of his circumstances enhanced the portrayal of the two extremes the use of the cumulative effect was brilliant hamlet knows early on what he needs to do but he keeps putting it off for various reasons by the end of the play he has amassed a whole army of reasons to kill claudius claudius accidentally poisoning his mother was just icing on the cake this element made the ending absolutely explosive as for elements of climactic drama hamlet features what i consider to be a distinct climax at the end when all secrets and subplots are exposed and everyone kills each other although it felt more like a climax to conclude a really long climax also many of the monologues and dialogues provide exposition as to what has been happening in denmark before curtain
