hamlet i hear thee speakso proceed you i heard thee speakso proceed you at this time the players have just arrived and hamlet begins to tell them what they will be performing he asks the players for a passionate speech he begins telling them about a speech he had ounce heard that he truly loved the speech was that of aeneid in which aeneas tells queen dido the story of phyrrus whose father achilles was killed at rome while telling the players this awful story hamlet uses powerful words displaying what phyrrus must have felt during the murder of his father this word usage of hamlet shows the rage hamlet has against claudius and also the distress of losing his father for instance in the speech hamlet is so intrigued with this speech because it is very similar to the events in which his father was killed and the aftermath of what happened in denmark hamlet picking these particular lines from the play is not insignificant hamlet tries to point out that the story of phyrrus is the way denmark should have ended up after hamlets father died hamlet should have received the thrown and it should not have been given over to his uncle when reading the story of phyrrus you can easily assess that what phyrrus was going through was very similar to what hamlet was dealing with also he was dealing with the loss of a father and was all of a sudden put into a position that he would never have thought he was face for many years his guard was let down and his inner feelings just werent the same throughout the course of this speech it talks about how phyrrus went from being very influential and powerful to fragile and unaware after the death of his father the rugged phyrrus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble this indicates that before his fathers death he was in total control of himself and the country however later in the speech it states phyrruss state after his father was murdered hath now this dread and black complexion smeared meaning that now that his father is dead what is he to do after being dishonored in such a manner this takes us back to hamlets to be or not to be questioning himself whether life is even worth living phyrrus is not questioning death but like hamlet he questions himself on how to go about matters in his country and also the reason for his fathers death after hamlet spoke of the story of phyrrus polonius applauded him praising him for his wellspoken accent and good discretion
