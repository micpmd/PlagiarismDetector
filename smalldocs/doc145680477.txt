hamlet theme sanity vs insanity hamlet and madnessthe third act of hamlet opens with a remark by the king claudius who instructs rosencrantz and guildenstern old schoolfriends of his nephew to discover why the latter puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy for over three centuries hundreds of experts have turned their attention to the problem of hamlets madness hundreds of articles have been written and dozens of controversial theories have been put forward and countered the characters of shakespeares play are themselves desperate to discover the origins of the affliction which mars the prince of denmark whilst polonius sees hamlets conduct as the result of disappointed love ophelia can only see the symptoms of pure madness for rosencrantz and guildenstern it is ambition and frustration which are gnawing away at the young heir to the throne finally for gertrude hamlets mother who in this joins most critics at the root of it is a warped reaction including rejection to the death of his father and her own hasty remarriage this interpretation does indeed play an essential role in the play hamlet himself never ceases speculating not only about the overt or covert motivations of other characters but also about the uses and abuses of power the faults of passion action and inaction the significance of ancestral customs as well as the question of suicide most of the characters observing hamlets behaviour cant agree whether it is fake and calculating or whether the prince really is suffering from a mental illness threatening the noble sovereign reason which separates men from beasts claudius claudius himself is conscious of the fact that the conduct and words of his nephew are at one and the same time completely irrational and absolutely coherent basing his judgement on the theories of ancient medicine he attributes the ambiguities of the deranged speeches to the workings of a harmful temperament provoking a state of deep melancholia what he hamlet spake he concludes though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger act 3 scene 1 in this respect a parallel can be traced between the methodical madness of hamlet and that of ophelia in effect whilst everyone agrees that their words have no sense their words and actions are still the object of an exceptional curiosity on the part of their entourage her speech is nothing the unnamed gentleman who opens act 4 scene 5 tells us yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection they aim at it and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them indeed would make one think there might be thought though nothing sure yet much unhappily what education in madness finally exclaims laertes meditating on a nothingness which is worth more than all thought what reason in this madness each character tries to decipher the madness of ophelia and hamlet because the ambiguities of their deranged discourses seem to reveal a terrible sickness capable not only of threatening the psychological equilibrium of the individual but of infecting the kingdom as well as the world beyond it goes so heavily with my disposition says hamlet that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours act two scene two however hamlets madness has not only the effect of disturbing those around him it also allows him the freedom to transgress the courts rules of etiquette and obedience without incurring immediate punishment hamlet under cover of madness takes on the role of a critical and sardonic commentator on the schemes of other characters and in this he succeeds yorick the kings late fool whose fate is the subject of a full discussion in the fifth and final act amongst hamlets principal targets are his mothers infidelity rosencrantzs servitude and the devouring ambition of his uncle whom he reminds by means of a riddle that all are equal before death hamlet a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm king what dost thou mean by this hamlet nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar act 4 scene 3 forced to play a role which brings him nothing but misfortune and alienation hamlet envies those who unlike him do not allow themselves to be tormented by the scruples of conscience for this reason he admires the equanimity of his friend horatio whom he includes amongst those fortunate people whose blood and judgement are so well comeddled that they are not a pipe for fortunes finger to sound what stop she please in other words whilst horatio no revenue hast but his good spirits to feed and clothe him it is precisely his ability to be someone that fortunes buffets and rewards hast taen with equal thanksact three scene 2 that allows him to escape suffering the stoic horatio who admits to being more an antique roman than a daneact 5 scene 2 does not succumb to destructive passions he does not nourish illconsidered hopes and in this avoids frustrations and disappointments it is because all these qualities are united in horatio that hamlet implores him before his own death not to give in to the temptation to commit suicide and to stay alive in order to tell the whole truth so what is the answer to the central question is hamlet mad is he mad partly because his pain and metaphysical doubt are beyond him is his madness a strategy for better observing and manipulating others and furthermore to protect himself or does he take cover under an artificial madness which absolves him from all responsibility and allows him to find comfort in inaction to split himself in some way to be at once an actor in and a spectator of the staging of life of his life or is he all things considered just insane each of us has to decide according to taste and temperament hamlets father the king of denmark is killed by his brother claudius who overriding the rights of succession appropriates both the crown and the wife of hamlets father the ghost of the father reveals everything to his son and all the elements of the revenge tragedy are in place hamlet has an obligation to avenge the murder the usurpation and the adultery this he does by killing claudius at the end of the play however it is clear that the theme of vengeance is merely a vehicle used by shakespeare in order to articulate a whole series of themes central to humanity understanding how madness is presented in this play when hamlet and ophelia are thought to be insane their observers try to interpret the reasons for their insanity claudius thinks he has a hidden secret iiii158 since he himself has a hidden secret rosencrantz and guildenstern think that hamlets ambition is the cause of his madness since they themselves are ambitious similarly with ophelia laertes thinks she is trying to tell him to take revenge for her father ophelia sings three songs to the queen in ivv and two more later in the scene after her brothers arrival she has an absent lover and a dead dad hamlet is unpleasant to her songs which were about lovers and unfaithfulness the final song is about the death of an older man ophelias madness was caused by the death of her father her loss of hamlet and her guilt about her infidelity to him
