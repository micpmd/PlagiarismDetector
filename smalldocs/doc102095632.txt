hamlet hamlet as many of shakespeares works have become is a classic it has transcended all time period and people today can still relate to this ultimate tragedy people today can still relate to the themes of hamlet the death of parents plotting of evil people backstabbing trickery and other such events that were included in the masterful play of hamlet some of the more memorable parts were when hamlet was contemplating suicide when king claudius was confessing his sins when hamlet was grieving over the death of an old friend of his in act 3 scene 1 of hamlet hamlet himself was contemplating killing himself many teenagers these days at least in my own experience have thought about it at least once things do become very overwhelming at times unfortunately for my class we had a classmate kill himself during our sophomore year after that people thought a bit more about it themselves i believe hamlet speaks of the troubles he is facing and the possibility of ending them all he then goes on to speak of what would happen after death what if life after death is worse than the life he is living now what if there is no life only eternal sleep and in that sleep you have nightmares what would be better living the hard times that we know are bound to get better or to end them immediately and face unknown eternity that is a very good thing to consider before taking any action upon your own body people often regret doing things without thinking them through fully king claudius is one of those men who take actions with thought behind them but not complete consideration in act 3 scene 3 he appears to be sorry for his actions to be repenting to the gods at first speaking of the horrible deed he committed in murdering king hamlet and then taking the kingdom for himself along with king hamlets widow queen gertrude king claudius recognizes that he is condemned for what he has done but thinking about it again realizes he isnt really sorry about it he is very pleased at the way things have turned out he is now the king getting whatever he wants and he also has queen gertrude to fulfill his manly desires many times in this world men commit crimes maybe small ones maybe large ones usually the person who commits the crime isnt sorry about doing it until he is caught and forced to repent his actions to be forgiven claudius is a lot like this hamlet has figured out what claudius had done to king hamlet somehow and now claudius is thinking about how wise his decision really is if he were in front of a crowd and that accusation were brought forward and proven then claudius would have repented with all his might but deep down he wasnt sorry about it alas poor yorick i knew him do we ever find ourselves realizing just how short and precious life really is once again hamlet illustrates this often too well known feeling the feeling of grief knowing that life is short and also that you werent around to know of the death of an old acquaintance hamlet is commenting on the death of a court jester he had known in his youth yorick in act 5 scene 1 hamlet begins to recount different things that yorick and he had done together and how yorick always made him cheerful do you ever find yourself reminiscing about past events when times were a lot simpler and happier wishing that you could just jump through time and life like that forever many people at different times in their lives or speaking to different people or just an object or sound that reminds them of past relationships or events often begin to reminisce about it all hamlet also does this when this play was taking place all three of those actions and events can be compared to modern day life with ease everyone who reads and understands this play as it was intended to be understood can associate many different parts of the play to their own lives or to lives of those they are close with hamlet is truly a play for all time a true classic of literature
