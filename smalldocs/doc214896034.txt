hamlet is only skin deep the theme that remains constant throughout the play is appearance versus reality which is shakespeares way of warning people that things are only what they appear to becharacters within the play seem to be true and honest but in reality theyre diseased with evil many of the characters within the play hide behind a mask of falseness four of the main characters that hid behind this mask are polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern the king cluadius from behind this mask they gave the impression of people who were sincere and genuine in reality they were plagued with lies and evil their appearance only makes it difficult for hamlet to uncover the truth polonius the kings royal assistant has a preoccupation with appearance he always wants to keep up the appearance of a loving and caring person polonius seems to be a man who loves and cares about his son laertes polonius gives his son advice that sounds sincere but in reality its rehearsed hollow and without feeling polonius gives his advice only to appear to be the loving caring father the reality is he only speaks to appear sincere as a politician to look good rather then actually be good and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in theeact 1 polonius gives his son laertes his blessing to go away he sends a spy to follow him and keep an eye on him this shows his lack of trust for anyone he gives the facade of a confident father who trusts his son to go off on his own in reality he lies about his trust for his son by sending a spy to watch him polonius further adds to the theme of appearance verses reality by ordering ophelia to stop seeing hamlet he lies to her telling her that hamlet does not love her he only lusts for her while in truth he does love her ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul throughout the play polonius hides behind his mask appearing to be honest loving parent in reality polonius lies manipulates people and eavesdrops on personal conversations polonius helps contribute to the theme appearance verses reality by showing how his appearance is not his true nature behind the mask there lies someone totally different rosencrantz and guildenstern two of hamlets childhood friends are asked by the king to try and find out what is troubling the young prince both contribute to the theme by showing their facade of being hamlets friends the pair goes to hamlet pretending to be his friends when in truth they are only there because the king requested them to find the truth there is some irony within the twins they are asked by the king to find out the truth by hiding within a lie by pretending to be his friends a dream is but a shadow act ii hamlet knows the purpose for their visit is to dig into his soul to find the real reason for his actions as of late as the play continues the twins are asked again by the king to go to hamlet and try again to find the real reason for hamlets behavior hamlet insults them at every chance knowing they are lying to him about there purpose of the visit tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with you finger and thumb give it breath with your mouth act iii as the melodrama continues hamlet goes with the twins to reclaim money that another state owes denmark in actuality hamlet is sent off to whither because the king claudius knows that hamlet knows too much and must be killed the twins show their appearance of being hamlets friends but in truth they have a hidden reason for visiting with hamlet both show that it will be very difficult for hamlet to uncover the fidelity hidden within the lies claudius gave the front of a caring fatheruncle until the very end of the play he didnt want the people of denmark to discover any of his secrets so he clandestinely orders two of hamlets childhood friends to murder him meanwhile the people of denmark think hes sending hamlet to england because he cares for him his devious actions just go to prove shakespeares appearance vs reality theme through the characters in the play the theme becomes apparent looks can be deceiving polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern and claudius all appear to be good and honest as hamlet finds out all are full of lies and have hidden agendas within them as each character is presented in the play they appear to be trustworthy making it a difficult task for hamlet to uncover the hidden truth about the nature of each character as hamlet best said it something is rotten in denmark
