hamlet when do you know a work of literature has stood the test of time when william shakespeare wrote it but why are his works so respected and cherished one of his famous works hamlet is still a favorite among actors and occasional readers alike but why why is shakespeares work still able to challenge and inspire people four hundred years after it is written the answer is simple shakespeares work though complicated will never have just one meaning hamlet will be interpreted differently depending on the reader shakespeare will always be powerful and applicable throughout time hamlet is a play about a young man who has different issues in his life that he needs to work out hamlets indecisiveness and the love that he had for his mother were two key elements of the play the first reason why hamlet will never lose importance is because of the incestuous relationship between hamlets mother queen gertrude and his uncle king claudius even in elizabethan times hamlet would have been disturbed by his mothers new love in act i scene ii hamlets disgust with his mothers incestuous relationship and pain over his fathers death is no more clear then in the lines of his speech but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would not hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me think not oft fratility thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor fathers body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourned longer married with my uncle my fathers brother but no more like my father than i was to hercules within a month ere yet the sale of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot came to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue i ii 138159 hamlet is ashamed of his mothers bed hopping however what hamlet is most hurt by is the fact that his mother was able to move on so quickly to him it appeared as if one day she was living on his fathers each and every word and then he next sleeping with his uncle the unusual thing about this situation was how accepting the people of denmark were to their new king in todays society there would be no difference in how the son of a mother might feel there would definitely be a distinct difference in how all other people would feel incestuous relationships are taboo and not accepted as normal and healthy relationships not only the son of the queen of denmark but the people as well would be much less accepting of their queen marrying her brotherinlaw only two months after the death of her husband there would be endless rumors and problems arising from such a relationship so the government would never allow claudius to become king the fact that incest will never go away and be an issue in whatever time hamlet is read in people will never grow tired of the play and will always argue about the incest element of the play another reason why this play will always be well read is because of hamlets indecisiveness the fact that hamlet had the chance to murder king claudius could be seen as a huge mistake and the climax of the play polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern and claudius all seem to be honest and noble as hamlet finds out they all are totally liars and have hidden agendas within them as each character is presented in the play they appear to be trustworthy making it a difficult task for hamlet to uncover the hidden truth about the nature of each character as hamlet best said it something is rotten in denmark they appear to be trustworthy making it a difficult task for hamlet to uncover the hidden truth about the nature of each character as hamlet best said it something is rotten in denmark if hamlet had been able to make he decision to murder his uncle when he had the chance the whole play would have ended before it truly had begun that would have been the climax of the play and no one else would have died now might i do it pat now a is apraying and now ill do t and so a goes to heaven and so am i revenged that would be canned a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven why this is hire and salary not revenge iii iii 7379 but hamlet true to his character was unable to make that decision fearing he would go to heaven instead of hell where he felt he deserved to be the instance where hamlet is deciding between murdering his unclefather and not murdering him is not the only time he was indecisive even in the act i scene iv hamlet shows his deathly flaw angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin dammed bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou comst in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me i iv 3945 it is quite clear that hamlet is unable to make a decision even though this spirit is right in front of him and has done nothing to either horatio or the other men who have seen him hamlet is still unable to automatically assume that this spirit is a good spirit this sets the precedent of how hamlet will react to all situations of conflict that arise in the rest of the play he lies to her telling her that hamlet does not love her he only lusts for her while in truth he does love her polonius gives his son advice that sounds sincere but in reality its rehearsed hollow and without feeling polonius gives his feedback only to appear to be a caring father when the reality is he only speaks to seem sincere as a politician to look good rather than to actually be good and act good on the other hand making a decision too quickly is also a very clear reason why this play is so cherished hamlet is a wonderful outlet to teach readers that your decisions or inability to make decisions can really cause more problems than good if you read through the play you will always find something to take from it whether it is a lesson on how to behave in a tough situation or a new found love shakespeare has the ability to intertwine so many different themes and ideas in this play the indecisiveness decisions that many characters faced throughout the play added to the meaning of the play if queen gertrude did not marry king claudius hamlet would have been king also if hamlet killed king claudius when he had the chance the play would have ended right there the decisions made throughout the play were a key point to how the play ended
