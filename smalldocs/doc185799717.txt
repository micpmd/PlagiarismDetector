and deep thought has entertained generations for over four centuries like must of shakespeares plays he uses philosophical thinking characters unlike shakespeares other plays there are numerous questions that remain unanswered at the end of the play the foremost and arguably the most important question could be is hamlet actually crazy is he faking his mental balance or has he actually gone of the deep end that sole question continues to question many brilliant minds and remains unanswered therefore as we begin the play is set in denmark during the middle ages where the house of hamlet rules all of denmark the story begins with francisco a soldier standing watch outside the gates of elsinore castle meeting barnardo who has arrived to replace him marcellus another guard and horatio a scholar and friend of hamlet soon joins francisco and barnardo horatio has been brought along due to francisco and barnardos claim to have seen a ghost while on watch while barnardo describes to horatio exactly what he has seen the ghost appears in front of them horatio tells barnardo that the ghost looks like the deceased king hamlet also known as old hamlet horatio tells marcellus that he will enlighten young hamlet the prince of denmark and the son of king hamlet that a ghost keeps appearing in the shape of his father marcellus knows where young hamlet is and leaves with horatio to find him queen gertrude other lords and attendants in the castle accompany king claudius who has assumed the throne since his brother king hamlet died he addresses the people telling them that although his brothers death is fresh in their minds it is time for them to rejoice his royal marriage to queen gertrude who was also his brothers former wife claudius next allows a young nobleman named laertes to return to france to continue schooling turning to hamlet both claudius and gertrude beg him to remain in denmark instead of returning to wittenberg for school hamlet agrees to stay and watches as everyone leaves the hall to celebrate his uncles and his mothers marriage he is upset about the fact that his mother married claudius within less than two months after the death of king hamlet the arrival of horatio barnardo and marcellus who have come to tell him about the ghost they have seen interrupts hamlet hamlet asks them if they have the watch again that night and barnardo says they do at this information hamlet agrees to join them that night in order to see the ghost that night hamlet and horatio are outside waiting for the ghost to arrive when the ghost finally arrives hamlet tries to speak to it but it only beckons him to follow horatio and marcellus try to make him stay but hamlet tells them to let go of him marcellus and horatio watch him leave and decide to follow him hamlet follows the ghost who finally speaks and notifies hamlet that he is the spirit of old hamlet hamlets father the ghost indicates that he is in purgatory i am thy fathers spirit doomed for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burned and purged away old hamlet commands his son to revenge his murder hamlet is confused and does not understanding what the ghost is talking about the ghost tells him that sleeping in mine orchard a serpent stung me alluding to the fact that he was murdered he goes on to say that the serpent is his brother claudius who entered the garden where he was sleeping and poured poison into his ear he died without having a chance to confess his sins and must therefore endure purgatory until he can burn away all of his sins the ghost leaves hamlet with the words adieu adieu hamlet remember me hamlet speculates about what he has just heard and decides that he believes the ghost the next day claudius and gertrude meet with rosencrantz and guildenstern two former friends of hamlet claudius informs them that he has summoned them to denmark due to hamlets madness he wants them to spend time with hamlet and find out what the reason for the madness is they both agree to do this and leave to find hamlet as rosencrantz and guildenstern leave polonius the kings advisers and ophelia hamlets love enter the royal chambers polonius notifies them that he thinks hamlet is mad because ophelia will not see him and has rebuked his love claudius is not completely convinced that this is the full cause of hamlets insanity he and polonius decide to put ophelia into the hall where hamlet has known to spend hours pacing each day so that they can tell if love is the true cause rosencrantz and guildenstern find hamlet who greets them warmly and immediately drops all pretense of madness he recognizes them and asks them what brings them to denmark referring to denmark as a prisons they refuse to give him a straight answer and hamlet infers from this that you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour guildenstern finally admits that hamlet is correct in his assumption that they were call upon the two friends of hamlet inform him that some players a theatrical group arrived in denmark with them that day hamlet then personally goes to greet them and welcomes them to denmark he asks one of the actors whether they can perform a play about the murder of gonzago they tell him they can and he then asks them whether they can also perform some lines he wishes to write for them they agree to do this as well and then leave the room left alone onstage hamlet speaks to himself about revenging the murder of his father on claudius or keeping silent due to uncertainty about whether claudius really killed his father he decides to try to make the players enact the murder scene as the ghost described it to him hamlet is hoping that claudius when he sees the scene will reveal himself as the true murderer of king hamlet i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions by watching claudius when the actors perform this scene hamlet expects to discover whether the ghost told him the truth rosencrantz and guildenstern report to claudius and gertrude about what they have noticed about hamlet they mention that hamlet seemed much happier when the actors arrived and that he ordered them to perform for the court that very night polonius interrupts and mentions that hamlet had asked him to invite claudius and gertrude to the evenings performance claudius happily accepts the invitation claudius then asks gertrude to leave telling her that they will put ophelia alone in the room so that she and hamlet may accidentally meet she agrees to depart and wishes ophelia luck in bringing hamlet out of his supposed madness claudius and polonius proceed to hide themselves behind a curtain or tapestry in order to spy hamlet enters the room giving his famous soliloquy to be or not to be that is the question he is grappling with the difficulty of taking action against claudius and the fact that he has not been able to revenge his fathers murder yet ophelia interrupts hamlets introspective commentary ophelia greets hamlet and tries to hand him back some of the tokens of his affection he previously gave her hamlet tells her that she should never have believed him when he told her he loved her and that she was deceived he tells her get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners hamlet leaves her standing there to deal with his words ophelia upset by his reactions says o what a noble mind is here oerthrown claudius and polonius emerge from their hidingplaces polonius still thinks the cause of hamlets misery is ophelias rejection of his love claudius however is convinced that hamlet is not mad merely deeply depressed and possibly dangerous he tells polonius that he will send hamlet to england as soon as possible that evening the actors come out onto the stage and proceed to perform a dumb show a silent scene in which they enact the murder of a king through poisoning ophelia confused by the show assumes it foretells the actual plot the players emerge a second time and start to perform the actual play an actor named lucianus arrives onstage and hamlet tells them that he will portray the nephew of the king lucianus pours poison in the kings ear and hamlet comments that he kills the king in order to steal his estate ophelia informs hamlet that claudius has stood up out of rage thereby stopping the performance claudius demands light to shine on him and leaves the room followed by everyone except hamlet and horatio the two friends remain behind and hamlet gleefully tells horatio o good horatio ill take the ghosts word for a thousand pound rosencrantz and guildenstern arrive and tell hamlet that gertrude has sent for him he agrees to met with his mother soon but they continue to ask him why he is so distempered hamlet gets mad at them for their insistence and grabs a recorder from one of the actors he shows it to them and demands that guildenstern plays it when he refuses saying he does not know how hamlet says why look you know how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stopsdo you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe hamlet leaves to meet with his mother claudius meets with guildenstern and rosencrantz he tells them that hamlet has become too dangerous to keep in denmark and that he s therefore sending him to england he orders the two young men to prepare to accompany hamlet on the voyage to that they readily assent polonius then informs claudius that hamlet will meet with his mother in her private chamber polonius decides to conceal himself behind a tapestry in order to overhear their conversation he promises to tell claudius everything that happens after everyone leaves the room claudius admits to killing his brother and laments the fact that he cannot repent his crime he prays to the angles to help him hamlet enters behind him and draws his sword preparing to kill claudius however when he realizes that claudius has been praying and therefore absolved of all of his sins he decides not to kill him hamlet chooses to wait and kill claudius when he is sure that claudius can go sent straight to hell with polonius behind a tapestry hamlet believes that his mother is the only one in her chamber as soon as he arrives he immediately starts to attack her incestuous marriage to claudius and tells her she has offended his father he promises to hold a mirror to her face so that she can see what she has become queen gertrude becomes afraid of her life and cries for help a cry that polonius foolishly answers hamlet having heard polonius make a sound behind the curtain pulls out his sword and thrusts it through the curtain killing polonius hamlet further tries to convince his mother what his uncle has done the queen is convinced that hamlet is mad hamlet shows her that his pulse is constant convincing her he is not mad she finally asks him what she must do hamlet tells gertrude to go to bed that night but to avoid sleeping with claudius he further tells her to let claudius know that he is not mad but rather merely cunning hamlet then leaves to get ready to go to england tugging polonius out of the room behind him claudius asks gertrude to tell him what the matter is she informs him that hamlet is completely mad and describes how he killed polonius behind the curtain claudius decides to pardon hamlets life but calls guildenstern and rosencrantz into the chamber he orders them to find hamlet and polonius body and to bring the body into the chapel rosencrantz and guildenstern run up to hamlet demanding to know where polonius body is hamlet riddles with them and tells them that they are like sponges soaking up the kings favors he refuses to reveal where he has hidden polonius and runs away claudius is upset that hamlet is running around the palace but he cannot order hamlets death because the populace likes him guildenstern catches hamlets and brings him to claudius who informs hamlet that due to the killing of polonius he is sending hamlet to england as hamlet leaves the chamber claudius prays that the king of england will obey his letters which ask the king to kill hamlet for him after hamlet leaves ophelia goes completely mad due to the death of her father and the loss of hamlet and she incoherently sings her songs rather than respond to anyone as claudius and gertrude try to deal with ophelia laertes comes bursting through the doors with a large crowd looking the kill claudius and become king after explaining to laertes what happened to his father claudius receives a letter from hamlet which tells a strange story pirates caught the ship hamlet was on and hamlet alone boarded the pirate ship after the battle was over he became their prisoner the letter indicates that hamlet is returning to denmark alone this excites laertes because it means that he will be able to revenge his fathers death claudius proposes that laertes fight hamlet in a fencing match with rapiers laertes agrees to this provided he is allowed to put poison on the tip of his rapier so that even the slightest scratch will cause hamlet to die claudius is uncertain as to whether they can trust the poison and so he offers to also create a poison drink for hamlet gertrude enters the room and informs everyone that ophelia had drowned herself while sitting on a willow branch over a brook hamlet and horatio return to the castle on the way they come to a graveyard suddenly they hear a large precession and run and hide hamlet wonders whose corpse they are carrying with them to the grave hamlet soon realizes that the body is that of ophelia as they place ophelia into her final resting place hamlet reveals himself and laertes immediately attacks him hamlet proclaims his love for ophelia and leaves with horatio hamlet later tells horatio what actually happened on the way to england hamlet found the letter to the king of england and discovered that he was to be executed so hamlet wrote up several new letters which explained that the fellow men accompanying him should be put to death as they are discussing the events a messenger gravies to inform hamlet that the king has bet laertes that he cannot bet hamlet at least three hits in a fencing match with twelve passes hamlet agrees to the match at the start of the match hamlet tries to apologies for killing polonius but laertes stiffly refuses it claudius orders his attendants to bring him a cask of wine he then announces that if hamlet is able to score a hit then he will drink to him and drop a pearl of value into hamlets drink claudius than begins the match hamlet and laertes fight until hamlet shouts one laertes disputes the hit but the judges rule against him and hamlet get the point claudius halts the match and drops the pearl into hamlets wine cup he then offers it to hamlet who refuses the match continues and hamlet scores another point this time gertrude drinks from hamlets cup much to the protest of claudius the last round begins and laertes is able to wound hamlet but in the scuffle hamlet and laertes switch swords hamlet with the poison lace sword wounds laertes suddenly the queen falls to the floor she manages to say the drink the drink i am poisoned before she dies laertes also falls to the ground from the poison he received from hamlet he tells hamlet that both of them are poisoned to death and he blames the king for everything hamlet realizing that the point of the sword is poisoned slashes claudius and wounds him with it hamlet then makes
