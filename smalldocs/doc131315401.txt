macbeths analysis in act 2 the porter extemporizes about the sin of equivocation and in many ways equivocation can be said to be the most important theme in this play starting from the weird sisters first words at the beginning of the play readers quickly ascertain that things are not what they seem the word equivocation has two different meanings both of which are applicable to this play the first according to the oxford english dictionary is the using a word in more than one sense ambiguity or uncertainty of meaning in words also misapprehension arising from the ambiguity of terms vol3 p 266 this definition is the one that modern readers are most familiar with and this kind of verbal ambiguity is a major theme in the play however this is not the definition of equivocation that the porter intends the second definition in the oxford english dictionary is the use of words or expressions that are susceptible of a double signification with a view to mislead esp the expression of a virtual falsehood in the form of a proposition which in order to satisfy the speakers conscience is verbally true this is the equivocation of which the porter speaks this kind of equivocation is similar to lying it is intentionally designed to mislead people for one reason or another this intentional ambiguity of terms is what we see in the prophesies of the weird sisters their speech is full of paradox and confusion starting with their first assertion that fair is foul and foul is fair ii 12 the witches prophesies are intentionally ambiguous and the alliteration and rhymed couplets with which they speak their omens contributes to the effect of instability and confusion in their words it takes one or two readings sometimes to figure out what the witches mean it is not surprising therefore that these imperfect speakers can easily bedazzle and confuse macbeth throughout the course of the play just as their words are confusing the witches entire role in the play is ambiguous they speak of the future yet they seem unable to affect the course of the future banquo fears that the witches words will enkindle macbeth unto the crown that they will awaken in macbeth an ambition that is already latent in him iiii 132 and in fact this seems to be the case as soon as the witches mention the crown macbeths thoughts turn to murder iiii 152 the witches power over macbeth is confined to suggestion and prophecy they are the final push needed to drive him to his predetermined goal are the witches therefore merely mouthpieces of fate there is a connection between these oracular women and the fates of greek myth and in fact the word weird comes from an old english word wyrd which means fate in macbeths case their prophecies serve only to suggest the future not to affect it in banquos case however the witches seem to be able to affect the future as well as predict it because unlike macbeth banquo does not act on the witches prediction that he will father kings despite his inaction the witches prophesy comes true their role in the story therefore is difficult to determine can they affect the future as well as predict it are they agents of fate or a motivating force why do they suddenly disappear from the play in the third act these questions are never answered the ambiguity of the weird sisters reflects a greater theme of doubling mirrors and schism between inner and outer worlds that permeates the work as a whole throughout the play characters scenes and ideas are doubled for example as duncan muses about the treachery of one thane of cawdor in iiv macbeth enters to find the minds construction in the face enter macbeth banquo ross and angus macbeth who will soon betray duncans trust even more than the earlier thane echoes the treacherous first thane of cawdor as in all shakespeare plays mirroring among characters serves to heighten their differences and macbeth is no exception thus macbeth the young valiant cruel traitorking has a foil in duncan the old venerable peaceable and trusting king lady macbeth who casts off her femininity in her very first scene and claims to feel no qualms about killing her own children is doubled in lady macduff who is a model of a good mother and wife banquos failure to act on the witches prophesy is mirrored in macbeths drive to realize all that the witches foresee much of the play is concerned with the relation between inner and outer worlds beginning with the equivocal prophecies of the weird sisters appearances seldom align with reality lady macbeth for example tells her husband to look like thinnocent flower but be the serpent undert iv 7677 macbeth appears to be a loyal thane but secretly plans revenge lady macbeth looks like a gentlewoman but has been unsexed and swears herself to bloody deeds macbeth is also a play about the inner world of human psychology as will be illustrated in later acts through nightmares and guiltridden hallucinations this contrast between being and seeming is the fundamental definition of equivocation one of the most ambiguous aspects of the play is the character of macbeth himself he is unlike any of shakespeares other characters he knows the act of killing duncan is morally wrong and yet he swears he will do it yet unlike other shakespearean viceprotagonists like iago and richard iii macbeth is not entirely committed to the evil he wreaks in iv he agonizes over the idea of killing someone who loves him as much as duncan does he knows what is right and what is wrong and yet he sees as his biggest flaw not a lack of moral values but a lack of motivation to carry out his diabolical schemes in this he is like hamlet who soliloquizes numerous times about his inaction however unlike hamlet macbeth does not have a good reason to kill nor is the man he kills evil claudius is an objectively bad man and a murderer himself the audience sympathizes with hamlet and his desire to see claudius dead but duncan is a good man a trusting sagacious and kind ruler who does nothing to deserve death macbeth is a character devoted to evil and yet his soliloquies are so full of eloquent speech and pathos that audiences cannot help but sympathize with him thus at the heart of the play lies a tangle of uncertainty if macbeth is indecisive lady macbeth is just the opposite a character with such a single vision and drive for advancement that she cannot help but bring about her own demise and yet her very ruthlessness is another form of ambiguity for in swearing to help macbeth realize the weird sisters prophecy she must cast off her femininity in a speech at the beginning of scene five she calls on the spirits of the air to take away her womanhood that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the toe topfull of direst cruelty make thick my blood stop up thaccess and passage to remorse that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between theffect and it come to my womans breasts and take my milk for gall you murdring ministers iv 4755 lady macbeth sees remorse and peace as feminine virtues and in order to void herself of such compassion she must be unsexed that she sees femininity as soft and kind is evident in the fact that she calls the waffling macbeth womanish telling him that only when he has murdered duncan will he be a man and whereas she wants to turn her mothers milk into gall she complains that macbeth is too full o th milk of human kindness iv 17 later she reinforces the rejection of her femininity by claiming that she would go so far as to cast off all of the motherly sentiments that go along with it how tender tis to love the babe that milks me i would while it was smiling in my face have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums and dashed its brains out had i so sworn as you however this does not mean that in rejecting her femininity she becomes a man instead she becomes a woman devoid of the sexual characteristics and sentimentality that make her a woman she becomes entirely unnatural and inhuman like the supernatural weird sisters with their beards lady macbeth becomes something that does not fit into the natural world in fact the corruption of nature is a theme that surfaces again and again in this act when duncan greets macbeth for example he states that he has begun to plant thee and will labor to make thee full of growing iiv 3132 macbeth is a plant here that duncan nurtures yet by planning to kill duncan macbeth cuts off the source of nurture effectively severing himself from the root that feeds him and perverting nature in fact the thought of murdering duncan causes macbeths heart to knock at his ribs against the use of nature iiii 14951 just as the weird sisters pervert the normal course of nature by telling the future macbeth upsets the course of nature by planning this murder in reflection of the disruption of nature macbeth and lady macbeths speech in the scenes wherein they discuss the murder becomes heavy graceless and almost syncopated lady macbeth for example says that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false and yet wouldst wrongly win thoudst have great glamis that which cries thus thou must do if thou have it and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone iv 2027 the repetition of the phrase thou wouldst in all its permutations turns this speech in on itself in a way that confounds the flow of speech this speech is clotted with accents tangling meter and scansion and the alliteration is almost tonguetwisting slowing the rhythm of the words just as macbeth and lady macbeth have corrupted nature the language shakespeare uses in these scenes disrupts the flow of his normally smoothly iambic meter part of the theme of corruption of nature is the compression of time that occurs throughout the act when lady macbeth reads the letter he has sent her she claims that his letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present and i feel now the future in the instant ivi 6466 by telling the future to macbeth and banquo the weird sisters upset the natural course of time and bring the future to the present thus when macbeth vacillates over whether or not to kill duncan he wants to leap into the future if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly ivii 12 he wants the murder to be over and done with already done so quickly that it is already over just as equivocation twists the meaning of words macbeths murderous desires twist the meaning of time thus beginning with the weird sisters in the very first scene equivocation in all its permutations from the doublespeak of the witches to the unnatural murder is threaded throughout the fabric of this act as the play continues the breach between the world of reality and that of illusion that is the core of equivocation grows ever wider macbeths famous soliloquy at the beginning of this act introduces an important theme visions and hallucinations caused by guilt the dagger of the mind that macbeth sees is not ghostly or supernatural so much as a manifestation of the inner struggle macbeth feels as he contemplates murdering duncan it marshals him the way he was going leading him toward the bloody deed he will do iii 5054 the same can be said for the ghostly voice macbeth thinks he hears as he kills duncan as well as the ghostly vision of banquo at the feast in act 3 in fact almost all the supernatural elements in this play could be and often are read as psychological rather than ghostly occurrences if this is the case then one must question the role of the witches are they too products of macbeths fevered mind rather than real presences the fact that they do no more that give voice to the ambitions macbeth already harbors would seem to confirm this idea but then there is the fact that banquo also sees these witches and hears their prophesy in act one their role continues to be ambiguous throughout the course of the play the dagger of the mind is only one of many psychological manifestations in the play while waiting for the opportunity to kill duncan macbeth finds that he is unable to pray a psychological literary analyst would read this as a physical inability to speak caused by macbeths paralyzing doubt about the correctness of the murder the inner world of the psyche invades the physical world the same can be said for the voice that macbeth hears saying macbeth shall sleep no more iiii 56 freud analyzed his patients dreams and interpreted them in order to provide an insight into the waking world macbeth cannot sleep he is kept from the rest he needs by the guilt he feels over duncans murder if he has consigned duncan to eternal rest he lives in eternal anxiety and torment over his bloody deeds macbeths troubled sleep is a metaphor for his troubled existence as well as the troubled state of the country in shakespeares plays the king was a symbol of the country he ruled in his history plays characters are often referred to by the names of their lands rather than their surnames therefore if the king is troubled as macbeth obviously is there are disturbances in the country this kind of relationship between macbeth himself and the country at large is seen in the conversation between ross and an old man in scene four the old man reports that by the clock tis day and yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp iiiv 89 this image of the darkness strangling the light of day is a meteorological manifestation of the murder of duncan the light of nature is suffocated just as duncans life was extinguished victorian writer john ruskin called this kind of mirroring of a characters psychological state in the weather and atmosphere the pathetic fallacy and the pathetic fallacy abounds in this play the old man describes duncans two noble horses eating each other and an owl eating a falcon these occurrences echo the slaughter of one noble man by another the unnatural murder of duncan plunges the country into physical as well as mental turmoil the image of an owl hunting a falcon is part of a greater framework of symbolism centered around birds in this play for example when duncan approaches inverness in act one he comments on the martlets he sees nesting on the castle walls he takes this as a good sign martlets are lucky birds lady macbeth mentions earlier in this scene that there are ravens croaking on the battlements and takes this as a harbinger of duncans death iv 4546 duncan the trusting optimist sees lucky birds whereas lady macbeth sees fateful ones perhaps both are right in any event fair certainly becomes foul for duncan as the luck of the martlets he sees becomes the death foreseen by lady macbeth in the ravens in act two characters discuss or see birds in almost every scene while lady macbeth is waiting for macbeth to finish killing duncan for example she hears an owl hooting and calls the owl a fatal bellman a bird whose call is like a bell tolling for duncans death iiii 5 the owl could also be fatal in terms of acting as an instrument of fate just as macbeth is in some ways an instrument of fate through the intervention of the weird sisters keeping in mind that wyrd means fate if both macbeth and the owl are instruments of fate it is safe to say that the owl is a metaphor for macbeth himself just like an owl which sleeps during the day and hunts at night macbeth hunts duncan in the middle of the night and then finds that he suffers from insomnia the old man describes an owl hunting and killing a falcon falcons royal birds in that the nobility uses them to hunt with so in this situation the falcon represents duncan and the owl represents macbeth is the owl macbeths familiar the weird sisters each seem to have an animal familiar a cat a hedgehog and another animal named harpier so perhaps macbeth himself has acquired a familiar through his association with these witches throughout the play dreams fantasy and imagination enter the real world the witches words become truth the dagger of the mind points the way to a murder done with a real dagger and in the porter scene iiiii a porter imagining that he guards the gate to hell turns out to guard the gate to a real hell in which the king is actually murdered in his sleep when he lets the thanes in he mentions that he and his friends were out carousing till the second cock iiiii 24 this statement calls to mind the cock that crowed in the bible after peter denied knowing christ effectively turning on and from him by denying his association in this story macbeth traitorously turns on duncan and kills him accompanied by the crowing of the cock a metaphor becomes reality in macbeths address to the murderers we see a recurrence of the be a man theme when macbeth asks them if they have the courage to kill banquo and they answer we are men my liege iiii 102 this answer does not satisfy macbeth who berates them as lessthanacceptable examples of humanity macbeth uses much the same tactic his wife used to push him to kill duncan their dwelling on the issue begs the reader to question what it means to be a man in this play both macbeth and his lady have a clear idea of what a man should act like in act one lady macbeth outlines the traits that she considers important for a man he must dare to use whatever means necessary to achieve his aspirations ivii 5560 she claims that she herself is less full o th milk of human kindness than macbeth more capable of casting away any shred of compassion motherly tenderness and affection loyalty or guilt iv 4560 but lady macbeth is not the only character that values ruthlessness and a lack of compassion as masculine even kindly duncan himself evaluates heroic action on a rather gory scale when the captain describes macbeths victory in battle he says that his sword smoked with bloody execution and carved out his passage through enemy soldiers with this bloody sword macbeth cut macdonwald open from his navel to his chin cut off his head and fixed it on top of the castle walls duncans response to this account is o valiant cousin worthy gentleman iii 2026 a real man then in the world of this play is one who is capable of copious bloodshed without remorse macbeth therefore is caught between a rock and a hard place on the one hand he has his wife urging him to be a better man on the other his men turn from him as his capacity for bloodshed grows macbeth warns the murderers that he requires a clearness in order to leave no rubs nor botches in the work of killing banquo therefore the men must also kill fleance iiiii 152154 he does not want a stain to mar his work the theme of stains and washing runs throughout the play from macbeths fear that not even all great neptunes ocean could wash this blood clean from his hand and his wifes flippant response a little water clears us of this deed iiii 7787 to these instructions to the murderers to lady macbeths famous out damned spot speech the macbeths are obsessed with the idea that some stain will link them to the murders and that the stain and smell of blood will follow them even when macbeth orders others to kill banquo far from his presence banquos blood still follows him back to dunsinane when the murderer shows up to report his success macbeth observes theres blood upon thy face iiiiv 1314 the blood itself is a sign of culpability as is clearly evident in lady macbeths punning comment that she will gild the bodyguards with duncans blood to seal their guilt banquos murder itself makes use of a common theme in shakespeares plays the contrast between light and dark while the murderers wait for banquo and fleance to approach one of them observes that the sun is setting this is no coincidence banquo is a bright and good contrast to the dark night that accompanies macbeths rise to power a man who does not allow his ambitions to eclipse his conscience at the moment that he dies therefore for the last light of sun to disappear is appropriate banquo and fleance approach the murderers with a torch and the light from this is the first thing the murderers see when they come on stage the second murderer says a light a light iiiiii 20 after the murderers attack and fleance escapes the third murderer asks who did strike out the light iiiiii 27 at the same moment the good and kind banquo dies the light is extinguished this interplay between light and dark recurs throughout the course of the play another aspect of banquos murder has sparked discussion among scholars for years who is the third murderer there have been many proposed answers to this question some people think that it is lady macbeth who expressed curiosity about what macbeth was planning in scene 2 some people think it is macbeth himself because he did not trust the murderers it could also be one of the thanes or a servant the three murderers could even be the three witches in disguise in any event the presence of the murderer means two things if macbeth knows about him it reinforces the fact that he does not trust anyone even when he has given careful instructions and worked hard to incense the two men he hired he still feels the need to send a third man to complete the job and ironically even with this extra assurance his plans are not completed since fleance escapes fate will not allow macbeth to kill of the line of men who will become kings at the same time introducing a third mu rderer rounds out the number of murderers so that they balance the three witches there is a power in the number three in fairy tales characters always get three wishes in this play macbeth meets three witches hires three murderers commits three separate murders and sees three apparitions the number three threads throughout the play adding to its mysterious and magic atmosphere one of the most compelling scenes in this play is the banquet scene haunted by banquos ghost and one of the reasons for this scenes power lies in its blurring the boundaries between reality and the supernatural banquos ghost appears twice at exactly the moment macbeth mentions him first macbeth announces to the guests that the feast is incomplete in banquos absence as he says this banquo appears sitting at macbeths seat iiiiv 4655 he reappears as macbeth makes a toast to banquo in front of his guests iiiiv 107108 it seems that each time macbeth thinks of banquo he has a vision of him in this way he seems more like the manifestation of an idea a figment of the imagination than a ghost lady macbeth says as much when she pulls macbeth aside saying this is the very painting of your fear this is the airdrawn dagger which you said led you to duncan iiiiv 7476 just as the spirit of banquo invades the party mixing the supernatural with the real world his presence in the scene mixes the realm of ideas with the physical world in the same way as the dagger of the mind in act two just like the dagger banquos ghost is the realization of macbeths guilt a metaphor come to life as the act opens the witches continue the theme of doubling and equivocation that threads throughout the play as they throw ingredients into their cauldron they chant double double toil and trouble a reminder that their speech is full of double meanings paradox and equivocation ivi 10 the apparitions that the witches summon give a double message to macbeth knowing full well that he will only understand one half of their words famously the apparitions warn him to fear no man born of woman and that he will only fall when birnam wood comes to dunsinane although macbeth himself has acknowledged that stones have been known to move and trees to speak iiiiv 154 he takes the apparitions words at face value forgetting to look for ways that their predictions could come true the doubling theme continues in an amplified manner when the witches summon the show of kings each king who appears looks too like the spirit of banquo frightening macbeth in their similarity ivi 127139 as if he is witness to a freakish line of clones each perfectly resembling the ghost of the man he killed this is doubling to the extreme as the eight kings appear macbeth notes that some carry twofold balls and treble scepters as if even the signs of their power have been doubled and at the end of this show the eighth king holds a mirror in his hand this king the eighthgeneration descendant of banquo is james i himself carrying a mirror perhaps to signal as much to the james i who watches from the audience this mirror carries the effect of doubling into the audience as well suddenly the plays james is doubled in the real james creating confusion as to whether the world of the play or the world of the audience is reality once again therefore the boundary between imagination and reality between fiction and fact is blurred through the supernatural doubling in the play james i is not the only character who is doubled in this play throughout the play characters balance and complement each other in a carefully constructed harmony shakespeares plays often contain this kind of doubling of characters for example banquo is a mirror image of macbeth in reverse a man who also received a prophesy from the weird sisters but who refused to act on it like macbeth he has troubled dreams but his are the result of a conscience that grapples with his ambitions and restrains them whereas macbeths are caused by his active fulfillment of his ambitions as we see in her rejection of femininity lady macbeth is also a foil for macbeth whose milk of human kindness has been transformed into bile in fact almost every character in the play could be seen as a double for macbeth malcolm for example is a good trusting king to mirror macbeths paranoid tyranny king edward the confessor is mentioned in this act as a man who can cure disease at his touch this mirrors macbeth who is a blight on his own kingdom macduff is also an obvious double for macbeth for many reasons both men are valiant soldiers but unlike macbeth macduff is conscientious and thoughtful whereas macbeth is bullied by his masculine wife macduff deserts his very feminine wife the parallels between characters continue all the way down to the three murderers who mirror the three witches another form of doubling that occurs throughout the play is the theme of costumes masks and disguises when they plan duncans murder lady macbeth counsels macbeth to look like thinnocent flower but be the serpent undert to beguile the time by disguising his motives behind a mask of loyalty ivi 7476 after the murder lady macbeth paints the bodyguards faces with a mask of blood to implicate them again as he is preparing to kill banquo macbeth comments that men must make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are iiiii 3739 when malcolm tests macduffs loyalty he explains his hesitance by saying that all things foul would wear the brows of grace even the most horrible of demons like macbeth is able to disguise himself iviii 29 and in act five we will see macbeth described as a man who does not fit into the princely robes he has usurped just as the witchs equivocation covers up their true meaning with beautiful words disguises and masks hide the inner world from the outer if characters double so too do scenes and plot points thus there are two scenes in which the weird sisters summon the future for macbeth there are two paradoxical prophesies for macbeth to mistake both macbeth and lady macbeth have troubled sleep there are two murders committed offstage and two committed onstage there are even two scenes of a mother and child the scene in which lady macbeth describes dashing out her babys brains in act one and the scene in which lady macduff comforts her son before he too is killed all this doubling in plot and scenes balances the structure of the play in a way that is uniquely shakespearean the scene in which lady macduff is killed continues the bird symbolism that began in act one when lady macduff complains to ross about her husbands abandoning them she uses a bird metaphor to explain her feelings saying that the poor wren the most diminutive of birds will fight her young ones in her nest against the owl ivii 1114 her metaphor comes to life when she and her son are attacked by macbeths men macbeth as earlier established is identified with the owl and lady macduff trying to protect her son becomes the wren in this realization of her own words her son too helps to continue this metaphor by telling her that he will live as birds do obtaining his sustenance from whatever he can find ivii 37 once again an owls attack on another kind of bird is a symbol for macbeths bloody acts scene one of this act is the mostquoted most familiar part of this play until this point macbeth has been tormented with visions nightmares and disturbances in his sleep while lady macbeth scolds him for his weakness now the audience witnesses the way in which the murders have preyed on lady macbeth as well in her sleepwalking lady macbeth plays out the washing theme that runs throughout the play after killing duncan she flippantly tells macbeth that a little water clears us of this deed now it is evident that this is not true as the sleepwalking lady tries in vain to scrub the stain of blood off her hands lady macbeths stained hands are reminiscent of the biblical mark of cain the mark that god placed on cain after he killed his brother abel in the story of genesis like cains mark the stain of blood follows lady macbeth and reveals her guilt to the watching doctor and gentlewoman however cains mark is a sign from god that protects cain from others revenge lady macbeths mark on the other hand does not protect her from death and she dies only a few scenes later the doctors behavior in this scene is interesting in that it closely resembles the work of a psychoanalyst but precedes the father of psychoanalysis freud by centuries like a freudian psychoanalyst the doctor observes lady macbeths dreams and uses her words to infer the cause of her distress like a psychoanalyst too the doctor decides to set down what comes from her as he listens vi 3435 after witnessing her distress the doctor declares it the result of an infected mind vi 76 this too sounds like the diagnosis of a modernday psychiatrist lady macbeths language in this scene betrays her troubled mind in many ways her speech in previous acts has been eloquent and smooth for example in every point twice done and then done double were poor and single business to contend against those honors deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house for those of old and the late dignities heaped upon them in this speech lady macbeth makes use of metaphor duncans honor is deep and broad metonymy he honors our house meaning the macbeths themselves and hyperbole in every point twice done and then done double her syntax is complex and the rhythm of her speech is smooth and flowing in the iambic pentameter used by members of the nobility in shakespeares plays what a contrast it is therefore when she speaks in her sleep in act five out damned spot out i say one two why then tis time to dot hell is murky fie my lord fie a soldier and afeard what need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him the thane of fife had a wife where is she now what will these hands neer be clean no more o that my lord no more o that you mar all with this starting vi 3647 in this speech lady macbeths language is choppy jumping from idea to idea as her state of mind changes her sentences are short and unpolished reflecting a mind too disturbed to speak eloquently although she spoke in iambic pentameter before now she speaks in prose she has lost that noble distance with which she spoke before lady macbeths dissolution is swift this sleepwalking scene is the last time we see her and a few scenes later macbeth receives news that she has died as macbeths power has grown lady macbeths has decreased she begins as a remorseless influential voice capable sweettalking duncan and of leading macbeth to do her bidding in the third act macbeth leaves her out of his plans to kill banquo refusing to tell her what he intends to do now in act five she has dwindled to a mumbling sleepwalker capable of only the rambling speech of the insane whereas event the relatively unimportant lady macduff has a stirring death scene lady macbeth dies offstage and when her death is reported to macbeth his cold response is shocking in its lack of interest here again macbeth stands in relief to macduff whose emotional reaction to his wifes death almost unmans him as the play nears its bloody conclusion macbeths tragic flaw comes to the forefront like duncan before him he is too trusting he believes the witches prophesies at face value never realizing that like him things are seldom what they seem thus he foolishly fortifies his castle with the few men he has left banking on the fact that the events the witches predicted seem impossible but in fact these predictions come true the english army brings birnam wood to dunsinane and macduff who has been untimely ripped from his mothers womb advances to kill macbeth the witches have equivocated they told him a double truth concealing the complex reality within a framework that seems simple it is fitting that the play ends as it began with a victorious battle in which a valiant hero kills a traitor and displays his severed head the first thing we hear of macbeth in act one is the story of his bravery in battle wherein he cut off macdonwalds head and displayed it on the castle battlements here at the end of the tragedy macbeth himself a traitor to duncan and his family is treated in exactly the same manner after killing macbeth macduff enters with macbeths severed head and exclaims behold where stands thusurpers cursed head vvii 6566 the play thus ends with the completion of a perfect parallel the moral at the end of the story is that the course of fate cannot be changed the events that the weird sisters predictedset in motion at the beginning of the play happen exactly as they said no matter what the characters do to change them macbeth tries his hardest to force fate to work to his bidding but to no avail banquo still becomes the father of kings and macbeth still falls to a man not born of woman the man who triumphs in the end is the one who did nothing to change the fate prescribed for him the course of time flows on despite the struggles of man although macbeths reign of terror caused the times to be disjoint iiiii 18 by the end of the play the tide of time has smoothed over scotland and macduff comments that the time is free vviii 66 thus macbeths life proves to be in fact a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing vv 2931 time will wash over his meaningless bloody history banquos family will give rise to a line of stuart kings and malcolm will regain the throne his father left him exactly as if macbeth had never dared to kill duncan at all
