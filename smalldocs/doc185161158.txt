aristotles influence on shakespeares hamlet many people believe that aristotles poetics have greatly influenced the way that shakespeare composed hamlet there are many instances in which this argument can be supported and other arguments where it just wouldnt make sense i think that shakespeare was influenced by aristotles idea but i believe that he did not strictly follow aristotles guide i think that shakespeare was his own person and not very influenced by other peoples works throughout shakespeares hamlet and throughout aristotles poetics there are similarities in themes and plot lines that may suggest influence from aristotle one of the main examples of aristotles influence on hamlet is the fact that according to aristotle a tragedy involves 6 parts of the story with a hierarchy of importancethe highest of which being the plot this is shown in hamlet because the plot appears to be shakespeares main focus of the story another argument is the fact that aristotle said that the plot should not be complicated instead it should be straightforward but the plot in hamlet is not simple at all another argument is that aristotle said that in a tragedy there must always be a tragic deed that will either be completed or not completed but in hamlet it was completed it is completed when claudius arranges for hamlet to be killed and eventually he does there is also a point in hamlet in that suggests that shakespeare was not influenced by aristotles poetics this point that suggests that shakespeare wasnt influenced by aristotle is the fact that the heros downfall or misfortune was not caused by his own hamartia aristotle states that the heros downfall should be due to his own hamartia but in my opinion it was claudius fault another argument not supporting the idea of shakespeares influence is that aristotle stated in his poetics that the hero of the tragedy must go from a life of happiness to a life of misery this is present in hamlet when at the end of the story a lot of people die including hamlet aristotle states that there are six parts of every tragedy that need to have a hierarchical standing within the story these six parts are plot character thought diction melody and spectacle aristotle chapter 6 this is present in hamlet because the plot is more developed than the characters are and the characters are more developed than the thought throughout the story and so on the plot as i will explain later is very complicated the characters arent very dynamic throughout the story but not to the point where it would make the story bad the thought that the characters use isnt all that great the thought process used by claudius at the end suggests that thought isnt high on the list of priorities diction throughout the story isnt very clear and there are footnotes to clarify melody throughout the play isnt as important as the plot line finally spectacle wasnt that great the scenes didnt give a great picture of actually what was there and it wasnt that exciting to begin with in aristotles poetics aristotle states that a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan aristotle chapter 13 lines 56 a complex layout of the story hamlet is what we have seen in hamlet there are many things that make the story complex the first and main thing that makes the story complex is the fact that the same person who killed king hamlet soon thereafter became the husband of gertrude the kings widow this complication would be simple if prince hamlet didnt know that claudius was his fathers killer hamlet knows that claudius is king hamlets killer because king hamlet comes back as a ghost and tells prince hamlet to avenge his death the ghost wants prince hamlet to kill claudius because he did not deserve to die another way that the story is complicated is that throughout the majority of the story prince hamlet knows that claudius is the killer of his father and he cannot possibly get a chance to kill him the only chance that he ever gets to kill claudius is when claudius is praying hamlet doesnt want to kill claudius while he is praying because he thinks that if claudius is murdered while praying then he will go to heaven hamlet doesnt think this would be appropriate punishment so he doesnt seize the opportunity what makes this all the more complicated is the fact that claudius eventually sends hamlet away to england because he fears for his own safety in doing so claudius sends a letter to the king of england telling him to have hamlet killed on his way over to england the boat that hamlet was on was attacked by pirates sending them back to denmark this makes the story even more complicated because now claudius has to come up with a plan that in itself is problematical his plan is to have laertes who is angry because his father and his sister are dead fence with hamlet in a friendly match claudius is going to put poison on the tip of the sword that laertes uses he does this so that if he pierces hamlets skin hamlet will then die to make this even more complicated claudius has a backup plan that involved more poison this poison was in a drink that claudius would give to hamlet if hamlet was deemed victorious hamlet did make the first hit of the match but he declined the drink from the king instead gertrude took a sip and died laertes then hit hamlet with the sword poisoning him but not immediately killing him laertes then cut himself with the poisoned sword and as he died he told hamlet that claudius was responsible for gertrudes death hamlet stabbed claudius and told him to drink the rest of the cup claudius died and immediately after hamlet died if this isnt a complicated plot line i dont know what one is not only is that one plot line complicated but it is not the only plot line that exists in the play there is also the plot line with ophelia and her situation this presence of more than one plot line would be unheard of for aristotle aristotle states that in a good tragedy the hero must go from being in a good position to a bad position aristotle also states that the hero must go from the good situation to the bad situation due to his own fault or hamartia first of all i dont think that the hero in this story hamlet is even a hero to begin with i also dont think that he was in a good situation for that long either at the beginning of the play hamlets father is dead this to me doesnt seem like the good situation that hamlet was referring to if this good situation does exist and the bad situation is the fact that he dies then it is not due to his own hamartia the reason that he dies is because claudius is afraid of him and wants him dead some might say that claudius wouldnt want him dead if hamlet didnt want to avenge his fathers death and that is his tragic flaw the fact that hamlet wants to kill claudius may be what eventually kills him but in my opinion it is not a flaw if i was in hamlets position i would do the same thing another one of the requirements for a good tragedy according to aristotle is that there must be an action that is serious complete and of a certain magnitude that may or may not be done aristotle chapter 7 in the case of hamlet the action is done and it is of a great magnitude claudius wants to have hamlet dead and hamlet wants to have claudius dead and they both get their wishes this action is serious because it involves the deaths of many people and it is complete because it can never be undone there were many deaths and there is no taking that back aristotle chapter 14 in my opinion there are many characteristics of shakespeares hamlet that make one believe that he was influenced in some way by aristotle i do not however think that shakespeare was influenced enough to follow totally by aristotles poetics i think this because there are amazing similarities between the two works and the main rules that shakespeare break are rules that would restrict shakespeare from fully performing up to his maximum potential of his work i think that shakespeare would also try to do his own thing i would find it hard to believe that someone with a mind as creative and brilliant as shakespeares would follow to rules and guidelines to the point where all of the rules were followed exactlyeven if he made the rules himself these rules were made up by someone else and i believe that shakespeare wanted to be an individual so he would deviate from these rules at least a little
