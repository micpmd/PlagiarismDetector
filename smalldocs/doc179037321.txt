heroism of hamlet a hero is defined as a person admired for his achievements and noble qualities while showing great courage though hamlet does accomplish his purpose in the play defeating claudius he has many flaws that can create skepticism over his hero status people often argue over whether or not he is indeed a hero in the play hamlet is an intriguing character because although he does not fit into the stereotypical role of a hero he creates his own breed of heroism throughout the play we learn of many personality characteristics of hamlet the most prominent of these characteristics is his innocence he was lost in a sea of corruption and evil he was the right intentions a majority of the other characters had selfish reasons for their actions for example claudius killed hamlets father to gain the kingship and to get his wife the only reason for hamlets actions was for vengeance for his fathers murder he thought that was the right thing to do to protect the people from an corrupted leader his innocence makes hamlet a very personable character which adds to the tragedy element of the play an extension of hamlets innocence was his uncertainty he constantly second guessed himself and his actions he procrastinated and thus made things more difficult on himself a very good example of this was when he had the opportunity to kill claudius he could have prevented a lot of later problems if he would have just killed him then hamlet did not think that it was the right time to murder him therefore he waited this was probably hamlets biggest mistakes in the play because he could have prevented the murders at the end of the play another example of his uncertainty was when he second guessed the ghost of his father he was hesitant to listen and obey the ghosts directions he had to prove that claudius was guilty before he would take any actions in revenge this uncertainty was very admirable because he wanted to be certain that it was the right thing to do hamlet is very different from the typical hero because most heroes retain a lot of confidence in their actions and decisions hamlet tends to contemplate his actions and weigh out the consequences before he acts hamlet is a very modest man he was a very reluctant hero that was very odd during this time because many of shakespeares other heroes were very somewhat arrogant hamlet did not want any attention and he didnt want to be the knight in shining armor like characters of that time he did not want the fame and glory of his actions he just wanted to deal with the problem and for it to be over with if another person would be placed in hamlets position they would most likely have killed the king in the beginning of the play and became the king hamlet on the other hand was very secretive about claudius prior actions he did not want to create any unnecessary drama and hype most certainly the biggest differential in hamlets character towards the stereotypical hero was his melancholy hamlet was depressed and grieve stricken throughout the entire play he even contemplated suicide at one point while other characters would have just been very angry and would have seeked revenge hamlet was deeply saddened and questioned life this makes hamlet a character anyone can relate to with all of the things that happened to him readers could not help but to feel sorry for him everyone has had hard times in their life and you can very much sympathize with hamlet it makes him even more of a hero to rise above the circumstances and hardships to seek revenge for his father hamlet was certainly a unique character in shakespeares time though he was very different from the typical hero he brought a authenticity and realness to the play it didnt seem like such a far off fictional story but rather a real life drama you can attribute that to hamlets different approach at being a hero
